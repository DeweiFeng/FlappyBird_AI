# FlappyBird_AI
Using AI to play FlappyBird

## Introduction
In this project, I used the python NEAT algorithm to train a model to play Flappy Bird. For the Flappy Bird, I used pygame to create it. To play the game, all you neeed is to run bird.py, and press SPACE to tap the bird. To see the AI, you can run run.py to see the AI play the game.
